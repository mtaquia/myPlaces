#My Places

This is a little program to colocate pins in Google Maps in Places you have visited.

1. Execute `python myPlaces.py` it will generate myPlaces.sqlite and myPlaces.js files.
  * E.g **_How many cities do you want to see?_** 3
    * _Lima_
    * _Piura_
    * _Iquitos_
2. After finishing the script open **myPlaces.html**

3. You can rerun myPlaces.py if you want to add more places and then refresh myPlaces.html

Any comment will be apreciated.
